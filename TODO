* Per-channel echocommands?
* Recognizing channels where the bot is a mod?
* Per-channel rate limiting instead of the current one-per-second globally
  - Where the bot is a mod, the default can be zero. Elsewhere, default to one.
  - Is there a way to detect channel slow mode automatically?
* Log showing channel game changes as well as online/offline
* Autorespond using whispers, eg for Jackbox gaming
* Song requests are spamming with "too long" spuriously (might be fixed)
* Song request "Skip" button not working
