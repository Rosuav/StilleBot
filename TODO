* Per-channel rate limiting instead of the current one-per-second globally
  - Where the bot is a mod, the limit is three per sec. In other channels, must respect slow mode.
  - Is there a way to detect channel slow mode on connection? If it changes, there's a NOTICE.
    - Possibly ROOMSTATE, but I'm not receiving those.
* Variables.
  - NOTE: As of 2021-01-13, all variables are stored in persist_status->variables->#chan->$var$
    and any that aren't dollar-bracketed are buggy. This may change in the future, with
    the persisted mapping NOT having the dollar signs.
* Add some example/template commands that use cooldowns.
  - The functionality exists, but it can be used in a variety of ways. Good examples:
    - Short cooldown, no else. A simple squelch effect (command can't be used inside
      fifteen seconds).
    - Long cooldown, 'else' has alternate message. Command gives you some actual benefit,
      and you can only use it once every hour.
    - Very short cooldown (2 seconds), 'else' adds to variable and has output with a two
      second delay that emits everything from the variable. Will batch up busy responses.
      - Would be perfect in a !!giveaway_ticket special, or anything where it's normal
        for lots of people to use it all at once.
  - And then there are the insane things that shouldn't clutter up the UI.
    - Attach event to !!cheer, !!sub, !!resub, !!subgift - ideally aliased
    - Send to !hypetrain. If {state} is not "idle", do nothing
    - Have five-minute timer on command
      - If command not on cooldown, keep silent
      - Else say "To start a hype train, we need just one more event within <time>"
    - Ideally, should stack the timeouts - each one starts an independent 5-min timer,
      and if any current timer is running, give the "else" message.
    - Can we recognize distinct people and ignore any doubled-up events?
    - This might require dedicated code. But it's fun to see how far we can go without.
* Across an update of connection.pike, retain the mod list, until such time as we get an
  updated list.
* Thank people for hosting (effectively a spam command triggered by a host notice)
  - Currently this is better done with Lisp Whispers, since distinguishing autohosts from
    explicit hosts requires authentication as the broadcaster.
* Pike HTTP, SSL, and keep-alive: what's going on? Is that why Chrome gets confused?
  - It's currently just disabled - we add "Connection: close" to all responses. Would
    be nice to figure out what's actually wrong and then reap the performance benefits.
* Allow the bot's commands to be individually enabled and disabled for a particular channel
  using the web interface. Would be subordinate to the active_channels feature, which gives
  a hard restriction and would prevent the command from showing up for enabling if it's not
  one of the specified channels.
  - For some commands (eg hypetrain), this can be done by shadowing with your own to disable,
    or to enable a hidden one, create one with the appropriate builtin.
  - There's now a !features command; needs a web UI. Shadowing will still be possible, and
    will be the only way to rename such commands, but activation and deactivation should be
    fully-supported features.
* On the bot's emote list, allow search/filter by text
* Advanced timer functionality
  - If there's already a timer of this command happening, allow the user to pick whether it
    adds another independent one (current behaviour), restarts the timer (cancel existing
    and create new), or errors out with an immediate message of some sort.
  - Optionally emit message only if online at the time.
* Raid finder: Also show recent outgoing raids to allow notes to be added?
  - Or just "pick any channel, add notes". Have it show the stream as if in the raid finder.
  - The allfollows display could be this, but it's nondiscoverable and could be quite costly
    for people who follow a lot of people.
  - Adding ?raiders will show incoming, but not outgoing, raids.
* Move "$$autoform||$$" from markdown.html into each of the files that actually wants it
* Use persist_status->path("bcaster_token")[chan] for all need-more-auth calls
  - Use ensure_bcaster_login rather than ensure_login for the retention of scopes.
* Importing of config export files
  - Ignore the active flag ("all" or "httponly")?
  - Create all listed commands, but don't destroy unmentioned ones (overwrite any with
    the same name, of course). Ditto specials, but whitelist the names, of course.
  - Identify triggers by their IDs, and merge accordingly.
    - What happens if they're in a different order? This is currently the only plausible
      way to reorder triggers, which might be significant.
  - Update timezone if specified.
  - What about quotes??? How do we validate their format?
    - Hand each one, individually, to the updater from the front end??
* Allow dialogs to be dragged around??
  - May have some awkward interactions with (a) dialogs that resize themselves eg commands
    advanced view, (b) window resizes, and (c) closing and opening a dialog. Especially if
    it isn't obvious what's the same dialog and what's not.
* Channel point redemptions triggering command-like responses
  - Will then tie in with dynamics. Rename dynamics to redemptions? Collides with repeats.
    Maybe pointsrewards?
  - Will need to report ALL rewards, not just for copying; the table will need to list
    every reward and allow it to have a command attached, but to disable dynamic management
    of any that weren't created by my client_id. (See the can_manage flag in the front end;
    it's 1 if editable, absent if not.)
* Is it possible to get a "recent messages" timeout? Would allow squishing of spam if the
  channel is too quiet. Might not be worth it though.
* Polish multi-voice.
  - This would allow the bot to see its own messages, but only if sent by a non-primary
    account.
  - Can this kind of auth be used to get host notifications??
* Login responses can now redirect to queried URLs. Check for all where this is crucial
  (cf MPN with ?document=) and ensure that the appropriate query vars are whitelisted.
* Dialogs now autoclose only if formless. Ensure that the annoying cases get forms
  added or removed as appropriate.
* Authentication on Firefox may now have issues with the default popup blocker. Can we
  comply with normal "click for popup" expectations somehow?
