* Per-channel rate limiting instead of the current one-per-second globally
  - Where the bot is a mod, the limit is three per sec. In other channels, must respect slow mode.
  - Is there a way to detect channel slow mode on connection? If it changes, there's a NOTICE.
* Log showing channel category changes as well as online/offline
* Song request by search??? (eg "!songrequest blargh" to search Youtube for "blargh")
* !jackbox ABCD to put the code on screen
* Thank people for hosting (effectively a spam command triggered by a host notice)
  - Get the user ID of the channel
    - https://api.twitch.tv/helix/users?login=miccoelaine
  - Query currently-hosting channels
    - https://tmi.twitch.tv/hosts?include_logins=1&target=60299966
  - Compare periodically :( No notification.
  - To avoid alert spam, record names until the stream goes offline, even if they
    stop hosting? Or record a timestamp when they disappear?
  - What about autohosts? Want to avoid spam, again, but it can be nice to acknowledge.
* Pike HTTP, SSL, and keep-alive: what's going on? Is that why Chrome gets confused?
  - It's currently just disabled - we add "Connection: close" to all responses. Would
    be nice to figure out what's actually wrong and then reap the performance benefits.
* Add a Logout link (to /logout) to all pages when you're logged in
* Go through all the web config pages and add user() to any user-defined text
* Polling:
  - Get more webhooks that give instant notification
  - Use the same functions for webhooks as for polling
    - ergo, use Helix for polling, not Kraken
  - Ensure that the hook lookup will find everything (see TODO in code)
  - Make sure all callers are happy with the Helix-provided info format
* Autocommands: have both minimum and maximum repeat periods (eg "15 to 45 mins")
  - Currently it has a single repeat period, with 15 implying "14 to 16 mins".
  - UI: If either field is left blank, duplicate the other
