* Per-channel rate limiting instead of the current one-per-second globally
  - Where the bot is a mod, the limit is three per sec. In other channels, must respect slow mode.
  - Is there a way to detect channel slow mode on connection? If it changes, there's a NOTICE.
    - Possibly ROOMSTATE, but I'm not receiving those.
* Variables.
  - NOTE: As of 2021-01-13, all variables are stored in persist_status->variables->#chan->$var$
    and any that aren't dollar-bracketed are buggy. This may change in the future, with
    the persisted mapping NOT having the dollar signs.
* Add some example/template commands that use cooldowns.
  - The functionality exists, but it can be used in a variety of ways. Good examples:
    - Short cooldown, no else. A simple squelch effect (command can't be used inside
      fifteen seconds).
    - Long cooldown, 'else' has alternate message. Command gives you some actual benefit,
      and you can only use it once every hour.
    - Very short cooldown (2 seconds), 'else' adds to variable and has output with a two
      second delay that emits everything from the variable. Will batch up busy responses.
      - Would be perfect in a !!giveaway_ticket special, or anything where it's normal
        for lots of people to use it all at once.
* Across an update of connection.pike, retain the mod list, until such time as we get an
  updated list.
* Pike HTTP, SSL, and keep-alive: what's going on? Is that why Chrome gets confused?
  - It's currently just disabled - we add "Connection: close" to all responses. Would
    be nice to figure out what's actually wrong and then reap the performance benefits.
* On the bot's emote list, allow search/filter by text
* Advanced timer functionality
  - If there's already a timer of this command happening, allow the user to pick whether it
    adds another independent one (current behaviour), restarts the timer (cancel existing
    and create new), or errors out with an immediate message of some sort.
  - Optionally emit message only if online at the time.
* Raid finder: Also show recent outgoing raids to allow notes to be added?
  - Or just "pick any channel, add notes". Have it show the stream as if in the raid finder.
  - The allfollows display could be this, but it's nondiscoverable and could be quite costly
    for people who follow a lot of people.
  - Adding ?raiders will show incoming, but not outgoing, raids.
* Move "$$autoform||$$" from markdown.html into each of the files that actually wants it
* Importing of config export files
  - Ignore the active flag but keep the allcmds flag?
  - Create all listed commands, but don't destroy unmentioned ones (overwrite any with
    the same name, of course). Ditto specials, but whitelist the names, of course.
  - Identify triggers by their IDs, and merge accordingly.
    - What happens if they're in a different order? This is currently the only plausible
      way to reorder triggers, which might be significant.
  - Update timezone if specified.
  - What about quotes??? How do we validate their format?
    - Hand each one, individually, to the updater from the front end??
* Allow dialogs to be dragged around??
  - May have some awkward interactions with (a) dialogs that resize themselves eg commands
    advanced view, (b) window resizes, and (c) closing and opening a dialog. Especially if
    it isn't obvious what's the same dialog and what's not.
* Is it possible to get a "recent messages" timeout? Would allow squishing of spam if the
  channel is too quiet. Might not be worth it though.
* Polish multi-voice.
  - This would allow the bot to see its own messages, but only if sent by a non-primary
    account.
  - Can this kind of auth be used to get host notifications??
  - Allow accounts to have a different default voice - probably just the channel's own.
    Then allow people to activate the bot, authenticate for self-voicing, and immediately
    start using bot features, with some restrictions, and with me able to lift those by
    granting them full permission.
* Authentication on Firefox may now have issues with the default popup blocker. Can we
  comply with normal "click for popup" expectations somehow?
* Enable/disable rewards - allow use of title, will do lookup
* Create a way to daisychain into an existing command. This will allow a special to
  "alias" to a command, or for a command to do things and then chain.
  - What should happen with nested information eg from builtins?
  - Will this make StilleBot commands Turing-complete?
* If you attempt to rename a command or add an alias that already exists (and isn't an
  alias for the current command), warn on client side and block save unless confirmed.
* Tidy up demo mode a bit.
  - Some pages have mutely nonfunctional buttons - they should announce that it's a demo.
* Goal bar templates - nice easy ones that you can use right away
  - Note that Twitch now has on-platform goals that track current followers and subs,
    so this can continue to focus on how many have been gained recently (eg daily
    sub/resub count).
  - All of them will be usable out-of-the-box, but have "Advanced" that lets you fully
    customize the advancement. Also, if you REALLY need flexibility, they are backed by
    the variable system, so any command or special can move them around.
  - Make the advancement command a proper thing. It should be broadly possible to hack
    together a bit-boss kind of thing if you want to.
  - Standard goal bars:
    - Daily subs/resubs
    - Daily sub points (ie tiered subs count for more)
    - Daily cheers
    - All stream support (subs, resubs, cheers, all worth their USD equivalents)
    - Any others?
* Special trigger when any goal bar tiers up?? Would be better than the weird system
  where it triggers an actual command. Could deep link straight to the editor now.
* "max-width: fit-content" doesn't work in Firefox - but nor does -moz-fit-content :(
  - Causes display problems on graphical editor and opening up element details
* Should runhooks switch to continue functions and then remove the "call next" feature?
  - runhooks is buggy. It needs to be removed in favour of 'inherit hook'.
* Should ALL specials function as implicit arrays, the way triggers do?
  - Alternatively: should invocations and executions be separated? Aliases would then
    be just another way to have more than one invocation for a single command.
* With the shutdown of Kraken, can we record things locally that used to be on Twitch?
  - Followed games/categories - you can still follow/unfollow but you can't query it in API
* Need to enumerate all the places where a channel name gets used as a config key
  (outside of persist_config->channels->username) so they can be changed on rename.
  - persist_status->bcaster_token, bcaster_token_scopes
* Art Share tool
  - Implement !permit command for temporary single-use access
  - Mod command to nuke the last-posted file?
  - Anyone currently under timeout or ban is to be denied upload permission.
    - Need a way to grant authentication for this purpose.
  - Add link to the /channels/NAME/ landing page once it's ready for launch
* Ghostwriter needs a LOT more error checking. Maybe, on error, reschedule check five mins?
* Get some default alerts, which will be there (but disabled) initially
  - Collaborate with an artist to make a default animation???
    - I say "collab" b/c this will need specific licensing terms, but I'm willing to pay
      the artist for this. Maaya's open to the possibility.
    - What license? CC-BY-SA-4.0 with special exemption that use unchanged as an alert
      in StilleBot does not require authorship credit?
    - Need: Follower - use the pie graph????
    - Need: Subscription (doubles as resub) - a long sandwich??
    - Want: Gift sub (maybe a gift box being opened?)
    - Need: Host
    - Want: Raid - parachutes descending. Take inspiration from a group drop, and/or the
      raid emote from MarissaMJArt
    - Need: Cheer (a fairly generic sparkle - don't use any Twitch properties, I doubt
      they'd give permisson to release the cheer animations CC-BY-SA)
  - Also track down any other freely shareable images/animations
    - Start with the pie graph, it's a good test
    - Any other freely reusable images? Where was that dog that a Some1 entrant offered
      as an alternative to Lenna?
  - Pick some default sounds from https://freesound.org/ - make sure they're all CC0
  - Host on rosuav.github.io, not as part of StilleBot itself
  - Have a JSON metadata file with, for every file:
    - File name (obviously)
    - Description (and intended use)
    - License
    - Origin (link to freesound for those, link to artist, etc)
    - Type (audio, image, video)
  - Have a "Browse" page on github.io, fully autogenerated by a commit hook
    - If a file exists and isn't in the JSON file, error
  - Add an entry to the StilleBot library for "Default Animations/Sounds"
    - Populated from the JSON file, obviously
    - Needs the descriptions to be shown somewhere... or at least a summary?
* Dynamic rewards need a major rework. Once the above is done, maybe the builtin
  can do the dynamic updates too?
  - Change the Add New Dynamic to let you select any manageable reward first
  - If you don't pick one, then you can create new (optionally copying)
* Classic command editor is lagging behind a bit.
  - Set variable, "extra config", that sucks. The whole destcfg thing is a bit of a
    hack though, so I don't think it's worth going to any effort for this yet.
* GUI editor - params need formatting options, in and out
  - Builtin params need to cope with splitting strings to arrays
* Firefox 98 has full support for dialogs.
  - The next Firefox ESR that will have this is 102, due out June 23rd
  - Test on ESR when possible.
* Rename "gifted" flag in sub alerts to "is_gifted" to trigger boolean handling
  - Migrate existing settings
* Ghostwriter: Event hosting
  - During a particular time window (okay if it's too wide), add a specific set
    of usernames to everyone who has chosen to host the event
  - Event names can be reused (for recurring events)
  - Who gets to create an event?
  - UI to say "host this event"?
  - There is no indication of who "ought" to be streaming. Just the normal prio
    list, on the assumption that the previous person will raid into the next one.
  - Auto-follow hosts and raids???
    - This part might actually be sufficient on its own. Once you join the train,
      raid chasing would keep you there: when your host target raids (only raids,
      no tracking of other hosts as that requires extra perms), also host the new
      target.
* Replace bcaster_token[name] with user_token[id] and ditto scopes
  - Have a compatibility function that returns a promise and yields the token
    when the name has been translated into an ID
