* Per-channel rate limiting instead of the current one-per-second globally
  - Where the bot is a mod, the limit is three per sec. In other channels, must respect slow mode.
  - Is there a way to detect channel slow mode on connection? If it changes, there's a NOTICE.
    - Possibly ROOMSTATE, but I'm not receiving those.
* Variables.
  - NOTE: As of 2024-02-29, all variables are stored in precached config named "$var$",
    and any that aren't dollar-bracketed are buggy. This may change in the future, with
    the persisted mapping NOT having the dollar signs. This may also coincide with storing
    them in their own table eg stillebot.variables, with channelid, varname, userid (may
    be NULL in which case it's not a per-user variable), and the value.
* Across an update of connection.pike, retain the mod list, until such time as we get an
  updated list.
* Pike HTTP, SSL, and keep-alive: what's going on? Is that why Chrome gets confused?
  - It's currently just disabled - we add "Connection: close" to all responses. Would
    be nice to figure out what's actually wrong and then reap the performance benefits.
* Raid finder: Also show recent outgoing raids to allow notes to be added?
  - Or just "pick any channel, add notes". Have it show the stream as if in the raid finder.
  - The allfollows display could be this, but it's nondiscoverable and could be quite costly
    for people who follow a lot of people.
  - Adding ?raiders will show incoming, but not outgoing, raids.
* Importing of config export files
  - Create all listed commands, but don't destroy unmentioned ones (overwrite any with
    the same name, of course). Ditto specials, but whitelist the names, of course.
    - Avoid recreating with identical behaviour. Reimporting an unchanged config shouldn't
      cause a full UUID rotation on all commands.
  - Identify triggers by their IDs, and merge accordingly.
    - What happens if they're in a different order? This is currently the only plausible
      way to reorder triggers, which might be significant.
  - Update timezone if specified.
* Is it possible to get a "recent messages" timeout? Would allow squishing of spam if the
  channel is too quiet. Might not be worth it though.
* Authentication on Firefox may now have issues with the default popup blocker. Can we
  comply with normal "click for popup" expectations somehow?
* If you attempt to rename a command or add an alias that already exists (and isn't an
  alias for the current command), warn on client side and block save unless confirmed.
* Goal bar templates - nice easy ones that you can use right away
  - Note that Twitch now has on-platform goals that track current followers and subs,
    so this can continue to focus on how many have been gained recently (eg daily
    sub/resub count).
  - All of them will be usable out-of-the-box, but have "Advanced" that lets you fully
    customize the advancement. Also, if you REALLY need flexibility, they are backed by
    the variable system, so any command or special can move them around.
  - Make the advancement command a proper thing. It should be broadly possible to hack
    together a bit-boss kind of thing if you want to.
  - Standard goal bars:
    - Daily subs/resubs
    - Daily sub points (ie tiered subs count for more)
    - Daily cheers
    - All stream support (subs, resubs, cheers, all worth their USD equivalents)
    - Any others?
* Special trigger when any goal bar tiers up?? Would be better than the weird system
  where it triggers an actual command. Could deep link straight to the editor now.
* Should ALL specials function as implicit arrays, the way triggers do?
  - Alternatively: should invocations and executions be separated? Aliases would then
    be just another way to have more than one invocation for a single command.
* Art Share tool
  - Implement !permit command for temporary single-use access
  - Mod command to nuke the last-posted file? You can already delete the message (eg
    time out the user) to delete the file.
  - Anyone currently under timeout or ban is to be denied upload permission.
    - Need a way to grant authentication for this purpose.
* GUI editor - params need formatting options, in and out
  - Builtin params need to cope with splitting strings to arrays
* Rename "gifted" flag in sub alerts to "is_gifted" to trigger boolean handling
  - Migrate existing settings
* Alertbox: For any non-personal alert, have a "Revert to Stock" which deletes the
  alert settings that you have, aside from the "Active" flag
  - It may be worth having Active be a single-attribute update, so when you toggle
    activation status, it doesn't save everything else.
  - When an alert does not have any other details set, it uses a stock alert. Thus
    you can easily enable and disable alerts, without having to do the work of
    creating them. (I think they should start enabled?)
* Find all forms in dialogs and use tag=formdialog instead
* Somewhere in either giveaway or pointsrewards, something attempts to query the
  rewards for Mustard Mine, which bombs with a 403 (b/c not affiliate). Track it
  down at some point; may need to add some instrumentation.
* Other support platforms? Which ones have integrations available?
  - Throne?
* Seek verification status.
  - Create a way to permaban a user??? It's sadly likely to become necessary at some point.
  - https://dev.twitch.tv/limit-increase
    - Applied 20240621.
  - Appeal to Twitch for the name StilleBot? If it can be made available, activate it as
    another voice, available to all. MustardMine will remain the default though.
* Bot sharding. What would it take?
  - MUST NOT disrupt external usage eg URLs
  - Each channel will need to stay together, meaning that all shards will need IRC and
    web connections
  - User preferences must be non-sharded; if you are using multiple channels, prefs are
    still synchronized across them.
  - Must be dynamic. This will allow bot restarts to happen progressively by adding and
    removing shards.
  - Might require a single central dispatcher. This is a minor problem but not huge (at
    the moment). Maybe the dispatcher can be the same code as any other shard, with some
    way to know "there are other shards over there and there"?
    - If possible, the central dispatcher should be able to move. Might require some
      careful handling though.
  - Incoming webhooks have to be dispatched to the shards
  - May be of lower importance now that the IRC connection can be sharded within a single
    process; this is no longer a startup performance concern, but a reduction in outages
    and potential geographic sharding.
* Per-channel per-user data
  - Variables - can use "$*foo$" or "$49497888*foo$" for explicit UID
    - Support this notation for cooldowns too?? Including aliasing via the builtin.
  - Channel currency?? Would become available as "*points" but automatically incremented
    according to rules like "+1 every 5 minutes to all in chat".
    - It's now possible to do this manually (have an automated command that adds to a
      variable for each chatter), but would be convenient to configure it in one place.
* Block bad variable names (those with "$|{}") on the front end - on the back end, those
  characters will be silently stripped out.
* Identify whispers better
  - When a whisper comes in, be sure we know which voice received it
  - Allow whispers to trigger commands in some per-channel way
    - Channel config->whispers_as_commands - no current way to set it
    - What about secondary voices? For example, whispering CandiCat could execute commands
      in #devicat and then whisper the response from CandiCat.
* Make the GUI command editor more accessible
  - GET A SCREENREADER and see how everything sounds. If needed, adjust.
    - Orca sucks. What others are there?
* Should Favourites become a tray like any other??
* Can we get "snooze raids" information?
  - Option: Snooze raids when you open the raid finder, unsnooze when you close it
  - Option: Query if the channel has snoozed raids, show a big warning
  - Requires API access to both set and query the snooze status. Note that querying
    may never be implemented directly, but on attempting the raid, may become visible.
* Cron job to track channels that have been inactive for a long time (maybe 2 weeks) to
  dispose of their configs
* Make connection priority dynamic
  - Inactive/deleted channels are excluded already
  - But idle channels should have nearly as low a cost
  - If a channel has been live within the past two weeks, it has "regular" priority
  - If it's in my notify list, "high" priority??
  - Maybe allow modules to add to an array of "reasons for priority"?
* During update of window.pike, sometimes seeing this:
  (stillebot.pike:535692): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: 10:15:44.496: ../../../gobject/gsignal.c:2732: instance '0x55b0f70e9970' has no handler with id '4781'
  - Probably indicates a signal connected to an object, object gets destroyed, then
    signal gets removed.
* Channel error log
  - Find other places that should be reporting errors and make them report.
    - We need to talk to you about your TPS, error, and warning reports.
  - Fully implement unread status - lift code from chan_messages as needed.
* MustardScript syntax highlighting enhancements
  - Use the https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/blob/master/src/ext/themelist.js extn to
    allow people to pick a theme; save it to their prefs.
  - Autoindent? After a brace, indent. After a builtin function call or keyword,
    indent if there was nothing on the previous line. Dedent appropriately??
* Minor changes noted during massive DB migration:
  - chan_giveaway.pike giveaway_tickets[] should use user IDs
  - Sweeping change: Eventually mandate that chan_*
    websocket groups use IDs rather than channel logins.
  - Remove req->misc->session->token. Instead, have req->misc->token which is
    taken from the user ID, and always store the token against that user (not the
    session).
    - Remove req->misc->session->scopes at the same time. This should leave sessions
      JSON-compatible; then convert the database to use JSON instead of encode_value.
* Failed auth when attempting to send a voiced message should be logged to the
  channel's error log.
* Can we get sd_notify support? Would be nice if, upon receipt of a "reload" signal,
  the bot notifies systemd that it's reloading, then that it's ready, and can report
  failure so the terminal gets an immediate response. (Failure details will of course
  be in the log.)
  - Requires systemd v253 for Type=notify-reload in order for this to work.
* Running into weird problems with app auth. Maybe the cached G->G->app_access_token
  needs to be purged at some point?? Possibly on reauth???
* Current limitation: Changing stream tags without changing anything else won't trigger
  a !!streamsetup special. No easy way to fix this without some kind of reliable poll,
  and there are lots of weird corner cases. Probably should be documented in a user-facing
  location though. Best fix: Have Twitch provide tags in the channel.update notif, and
  have that notif also sent when tags are changed.
* Follower alerts/special trigger
  - There's no way to get notified when I receive a new modsword, sadly. May need to
    periodically recheck, or ping all voice accounts when one is authenticated, or when
    a broadcaster does something like adding the !!follower special.
    - Do I get notified if bot is in chat when it receives the sword?
  - Query all of that channel's voices - most importantly, all the default voices - for
    their modswords
  - If any voice both has a modsword for a channel and has the moderator:read:followers
    scope, it can be used for follower hooks.
* VIP Leaderboard: Have a "claim tips" button
  - We already keep email addresses (I think?)
  - Let people log in with Twitch. If it's the same address, they can claim the tips
    and be credited for them on the board.
  - Retain the original name. If someone wants to donate VIP, they can unclaim a tip
    and it'll go by name not email.
  - Once someone has claimed their tips, it should default to claiming future tips
    (but this can be turned off per user).
  - If they DON'T use the same email address, is it worth having an email verification
    system (send a unique link, they can claim those tips)?
* Chrome Youtube Music integration
  - Like VLC integration, it could link in with variables and whatnot
  - Provide a Chrome extension.
  - Extension connects to the websocket. Initially, it does not have authentication.
  - A button on the Stillebot page authenticates (claims) an unrecognized connection?
    Or do it magically based on IP address?
  - The extension stores the magic cookie in local storage
  - Watch for song changes. Also support a volume control?? Wouldn't work for VLC as the
    Lua extension doesn't establish a bidirectional connection.
  - Try to get both the URL and the song title (as Unicode, no mojibake thanks)
* In interactive mode, have an explore(mixed value) that will create a GTK window to
  show the value, same as Internals does
* Patreon integration
  - Alerts. Include a field showing the membership tier, to allow variants, eg no
    alert for free members (aka followers)
  - VIP status for all patreons at some minimum level (don't set to 0 or free members
    will get it)
    - Would require that people link their Patreon and Twitch - one-off but since it's
      not supported by Patreon themselves, has to be done on Mustard Mine
    - Whenever you resync, add new VIPs for anyone who is a supporter
    - Track failure to add VIPs and don't unvip them later
    - Remove VIP from anyone who is no longer a supporter
    - React to members:create, members:delete, and possibly members:pledge:create/delete?
  - Can we have a builtin that iterates over all current patrons?
  - Note that members:create includes free memberships. May need a "membership upgrade"
    alert too?
* Possible alertbox filtering?
  - Create multiple links that are able to react to alerts
  - Filter which alerts will be shown on which links
* Charity donations affecting goal bars?
  - https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference/#get-charity-campaign-donations
  - https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/eventsub/eventsub-subscription-types/#channelcharity_campaigndonate
  - Would allow more complex goal bars than the default ones, eg tiered
* Now that _send_recursive is an async function:
  - This allows callers to know when a command has been fully processed. Currently we
    use hacks instead in some places. (Any left after simulate is redone?)
  - An error thrown from a slash command should block subsequent text from being sent
  - What are the consequences? CHECK EVERYWHERE.
* Form submissions display
  - Show Archived Only
  - Select All
  - See All Fields
* Possible bug: If ws_type is set on a module, it is still storing itself into
  websockets_types[] and websockets_groups[] by name. Check for consequences. Currently
  no modules actually do this, but it is documented as legal.
* Switch bit boss to use grouped variables $boss:avatar$ etc
  - Don't change existing ones, just change the template for new ones
  - Is it worth changing it around fundamentally, or just (for now at least) changing the
    variable names used? Should varname become "boss" or "boss:dmg"?
  - Check how varname and text are used here. Consider removing the need for text altogether.
* Document the semantics of monitor autoreset somewhere.
  - Stream Offline seems intuitive, but explain the half-hour gap; notably, if you query the
    monitor in a streamoffline special trigger, you will see the stream's data, guaranteed.
  - Monthly (and any other fixed-time reset) will use your timezone and query some part of it,
    in this case year:month, and records the last time it was reset.
    - If you go online and the time portion has changed, reset immediately.
    - If you go offline and the time portion has changed, queue a reset per "end of stream"
      mode, and immediately update the recorded timepart.
    - Otherwise, poll periodically for any that have this status. If they have changed, and
      the stream isn't online, reset immediately; if stream IS online, flag for one EOS reset.
  - Note that this should never reset while you are online, unless it's right at the start of
    the stream (first few minutes), and ideally not then either.
* Now that file ownership is being recorded, it would be of value to differentiate in the
  front end, keeping unlocks from cluttering up the alert box and vice versa. Be aware that
  legacy uploads have no ownership and are most likely (but not certainly) alertbox files.
* Pile of Pics hype mode
  - When two things collide, they merge.
    - If the new size exceeds the base size of a different thing type, switch to that
      type. Either way, report back to the server, so that refreshing the page will
      respawn the exact same set of items. This will be VERY messed-up if there are
      multiple instances, including the preview, so have the preview not do this.
  - The server currently cannot record anything other than the thing quantities.
    This might be the excuse needed to change that, and thus allow refreshing when a
    person's avatar is texturing a thing. In effect, we'd need to record not just the
    quantity, but an array of vital statistics: size, texture, label
* Fourth Wall integrations enhancements
  - Make chan_integrations a builtin
  - Subcommands for different APIs
  - https://docs.fourthwall.com/open-api/#tag/Giveaway-links/operation/createGiveawayLinks
* UNTRACKED BUG: Sometimes, if replication ceases, it doesn't resume.
  - It may help to use `./dbctl refreshrepl` to force it to restart. Not sure if it makes
    any difference but it can cause an error message. See if we get that error any other
    way (check the logs).
  - If it reports "certificate verify failed", it's probably that certificate rollover has
    happened and the other end isn't using the new cert. Go to the other end and run
    `sudo systemctl reload postgres` which shouldn't otherwise break anything. I hope.
  - Why is this even a thing? Shouldn't the cert rollover automatically signal all apps?
  - Actually maybe it isn't signalling all apps, but that would be stillebot itself, so
    unrelated to this symptom. Unsure. That should probably be fixed too - at the moment,
    the bot has to have at least some level of major development every month or so, which
    is fine so long as it's getting that multiple times a week, but eventually it won't be.
* /serverstatus during hop from Gideon to Sikorsky might be losing the Gideon socket?? It's
  staying with the Gideon database reporting that it's read/write but it isn't actually RW.
* Can I implement Happy Eyeballs into poll.pike::get_url_data() ?
  - Probably not a huge priority; IPv6 support does exist in core, but it might be nice to
    spawn multiple concurrent queries, with the first one to respond being used. Only
    relevant when Sikorsky's or Gideon's IPv6 routing is broken, which has happened but is
    probably a big enough problem to fix that way rather than with Happy Eyeballs.
* "Drag me to OBS" might not be working in current versions of OBS - look into it.
  - Or maybe it's that browser sources are broken???
