* Per-channel rate limiting instead of the current one-per-second globally
  - Where the bot is a mod, the limit is three per sec. In other channels, must respect slow mode.
  - Is there a way to detect channel slow mode on connection? If it changes, there's a NOTICE.
* Log showing channel category changes as well as online/offline
* Autorespond using whispers, eg for Jackbox gaming (framework exists, not easy to do yet)
* Song request by search??? (eg "!songrequest blargh" to search Youtube for "blargh")
* !jackbox ABCD to put the code on screen
