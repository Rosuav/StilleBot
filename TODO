* Per-channel rate limiting instead of the current one-per-second globally
  - Where the bot is a mod, the limit is three per sec. In other channels, must respect slow mode.
  - Is there a way to detect channel slow mode on connection? If it changes, there's a NOTICE.
* Log showing channel category changes as well as online/offline
* Song request by search??? (eg "!songrequest blargh" to search Youtube for "blargh")
* !jackbox ABCD to put the code on screen
* Notice followers (would need a new API to get the info)
* Timed/automated commands
* Thank people for hosting (effectively a spam command triggered by a host notice)
  - Get the user ID of the channel
    - https://api.twitch.tv/helix/users?login=miccoelaine
  - Query currently-hosting channels
    - https://tmi.twitch.tv/hosts?include_logins=1&target=60299966
  - Compare periodically :( No notification.
  - To avoid alert spam, record names until the stream goes offline, even if they
    stop hosting? Or record a timestamp when they disappear?
  - What about autohosts? Want to avoid spam, again, but it can be nice to acknowledge.
* GitHub Pages info for all commands - generate it on update from all commands' docstrings
