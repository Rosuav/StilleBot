* Per-channel rate limiting instead of the current one-per-second globally
  - Where the bot is a mod, the limit is three per sec. In other channels, must respect slow mode.
  - Is there a way to detect channel slow mode on connection? If it changes, there's a NOTICE.
    - Possibly ROOMSTATE, but I'm not receiving those.
* Song request by search??? (eg "!songrequest blargh" to search Youtube for "blargh")
* Variables.
  - Tie in with a potential browsersource so "!jackbox ABCD" could put the code on screen
  - NOTE: As of 2021-01-13, all variables are stored in persist_status->variables->#chan->$var$
    and any that aren't dollar-bracketed are buggy. This may change in the future, with
    the persisted mapping NOT having the dollar signs.
  - Create external access link. It'll give you a link and save a nonce for auth.
  - Revoke external access link. (There can be multiple.) Should they be describable?
  - In variable management, allow variables to be deleted.
    - After check_for_variables, if it's been set to anything other than View, warn that
      it'll recreate the variable on next use.
    - Similarly, if it's been set to View, warn that the command won't work right after.
    - External access. These will be invalidated even if the variable is recreated.
    - Allow cascading deletion
* Thank people for hosting (effectively a spam command triggered by a host notice)
  - Currently this is better done with Lisp Whispers, since distinguishing autohosts from
    explicit hosts requires authentication as the broadcaster.
* Pike HTTP, SSL, and keep-alive: what's going on? Is that why Chrome gets confused?
  - It's currently just disabled - we add "Connection: close" to all responses. Would
    be nice to figure out what's actually wrong and then reap the performance benefits.
* Go through all the web config pages and add user() to any user-defined text
* Use the "special responses" system to customize texts like shoutouts? Would need a way
  to provide default text, and then explicitly removing it would mean "don't do this".
* Allow the bot's commands to be individually enabled and disabled for a particular channel
  using the web interface. Would be subordinate to the active_channels feature, which gives
  a hard restriction and would prevent the command from showing up for enabling if it's not
  one of the specified channels.
  - Would be good for the !hypetrain command, especially, since it could then be activated
    independently to the allcmds status (cf DeviCat).
* On the bot's emote list, allow search/filter by text
* Allow commands to contain spaces. They cannot ever be invoked that way, but some commands
  could look for them, so for instance shoutout.pike could look for "!so someusername" and
  if found, use that text instead. (Thanks Mirror for the idea!)
* Advanced timer functionality
  - If there's already a timer of this command happening, allow the user to pick whether it
    adds another independent one (current behaviour), restarts the timer (cancel existing
    and create new), or errors out with an immediate message of some sort.
  - Optionally emit message only if online at the time.
* Raid finder: Also show recent outgoing raids to allow notes to be added?
  - Or just "pick any channel, add notes". Have it show the stream as if in the raid finder.
