* Per-channel rate limiting instead of the current one-per-second globally
  - Where the bot is a mod, the limit is three per sec. In other channels, must respect slow mode.
  - Is there a way to detect channel slow mode on connection? If it changes, there's a NOTICE.
    - Possibly ROOMSTATE, but I'm not receiving those.
* Song request by search??? (eg "!songrequest blargh" to search Youtube for "blargh")
* !jackbox ABCD to put the code on screen
* Thank people for hosting (effectively a spam command triggered by a host notice)
  - Get the user ID of the channel
    - https://api.twitch.tv/helix/users?login=miccoelaine
  - Query currently-hosting channels
    - https://tmi.twitch.tv/hosts?include_logins=1&target=60299966
  - Compare periodically :( No notification.
  - To avoid alert spam, record names until the stream goes offline, even if they
    stop hosting? Or record a timestamp when they disappear?
  - What about autohosts? Want to avoid spam, again, but it can be nice to acknowledge.
* Pike HTTP, SSL, and keep-alive: what's going on? Is that why Chrome gets confused?
  - It's currently just disabled - we add "Connection: close" to all responses. Would
    be nice to figure out what's actually wrong and then reap the performance benefits.
* Add a Logout link (to /logout) to all pages when you're logged in
* Go through all the web config pages and add user() to any user-defined text
* Polling:
  - Get more webhooks that give instant notification
    - Actually, they aren't always any better - it's SLOWER than polling for
      stream-live and stream-down notifications
  - Use the same functions for webhooks as for polling
    - ergo, use Helix for polling, not Kraken
    - Some can't be changed. Offline channel info still requires Kraken as of 20191223.
  - Make sure all callers are happy with the Helix-provided info format
* Create a variant of !permit where, instead of stopping someone from being timed out,
  it lets them whisper a single link?
  - Would make it functional in channels where they're hard-blocked at the Twitch end.
  - Problem: a bad link can't just be purged by a mod, since it's come from another mod.
* Can the bot delete one of his own previously-posted messages without losing sword? Test.
  - "/delete msg-id" doesn't remove a sword. However, the bot doesn't see his own message
    IDs. This makes things hard.
* What happens if there's a long HTTP connection and you update code?
  - Currently I don't do much with websockets, but it can be tested using songreq.html.
* Use the "special responses" system to customize texts like shoutouts? Would need a way
  to provide default text, and then explicitly removing it would mean "don't do this".
* Allow the bot's commands to be individually enabled and disabled for a particular channel
  using the web interface. Would then largely subsume the active_channels feature, although
  that way would still be more performant if it's for a very narrow set of channels (eg 1).
* On the bot's emote list, allow search/filter by text
* Allow commands to contain spaces. They cannot ever be invoked that way, but some commands
  could look for them, so for instance shoutout.pike could look for "!so someusername" and
  if found, use that text instead. (Thanks Mirror for the idea!)
* New command type: Counter
  - !newcounter !death Good job, you died %d times
  - Typing !death will increment it
  - Record the stats same as quotes, keyed by the command name
* New command type: Timer
  - !newtimer !hypetrain 1:0:0 A hype train can happen again!
  - Maybe have a detailed thing in the web allowing customization of initial response, clash
    behaviour (reset time or error), and message when it expires
  - Just like with permanent autocommands, emit only if online at the time.
* Raid target finder
  - Look at your follow list (will need proper logins, now possible - see G->G->twitchlogin)
  - For each channel, show thumbnail (maybe), viewer count if poss, category, as per follow list
  - Look up recent raids and show the date/time of the last sighted raid
  - Works only for channels that I track, but I don't have to bot for them.
