# Repeated commands for $$channel$$

$$repeats$$

Create new autocommands with [!repeat](https://rosuav.github.io/StilleBot/commands/repeat)
and remove them with [!unrepeat](https://rosuav.github.io/StilleBot/commands/repeat).
Autocommands can either display text, or execute a command. It's usually easiest to tie
each autocommand to an [echo command](https://rosuav.github.io/StilleBot/commands/addcmd).
