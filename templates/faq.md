## So what's with the name?

It's an Alice in Wonderland reference. When Alice and the Duchess were discussing
all manner of things and their morals, they determined that mustard was a mineral -
and one that was mined. And the moral of that became the motto of this bot: "The
more [work] there is of mine, the less there is of yours".

Other names you'll see associated with this bot include StilleBot (the name of the
bot's software), Rosuav (the name of the bot's author), Pike (the programming
language the bot uses), and Chocolate Factory (the front end UI library used).

## Is it really free?

Yep. At the moment, I have no monetization plans; if you want to donate, you're
welcome to, but all features are available to everyone. In the future, I may offer
some sort of paid cosmetic enhancements, but all core features should always remain
free to use.

## Your bot is speaking in my channel and I don't like it.

Sorry about that! You can remove the bot from your channel by going to your [Master
Control Panel](/c/mastercontrol); only the broadcaster can do this, and it requires
confirmation.

## Who makes this bot?

The bot is the creation of Rosuav, found under that name on Twitch, Discord, GitHub,
and pretty much everywhere. Contact him with further questions.

[The bot's source code](https://github.com/rosuav/stillebot) is available to anyone
who wishes to use it, learn from it, or borrow code from it.
