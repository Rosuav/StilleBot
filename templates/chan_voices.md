# Available voices for $$channel$$

Normally the channel bot will speak using its own voice, as defined by the
bot's login. However, for certain situations, it is preferable to allow the bot
to speak using some other voice. This requires authentication as the new voice,
which is not necessarily who you're currently logged in as.

You must first be a channel moderator to enable this, and then must also have
the credentials for the voice you plan to use (be it the broadcaster or some
dedicated bot account).
