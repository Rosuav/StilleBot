# Host viewer

Monitor who's hosting a particular channel (preferably yours or one you mod for,
but I'm not going to enforce that). Can be used for research into autohosting
timings or just to notice who's now hosting you.

The destination page can be bookmarked with the channel ID for convenience.
This window works well as a small popup or embedded in OBS or equivalent.
