# Special responses for $$channel$$

When certain events happen, StilleBot can automatically react, to thank a
person or celebrate an activity etc. Every event is triggered by somebody -
the initiator of the special action - and many events have additional information
available. For example, when someone [cheers](https://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/articles/2449458)
in your channel, StilleBot can thank the person with a message such as:

<pre>Thank you for the {bits} bits, $$$$!

MustardMine: This is a test cheer cheer100
StilleBot: Thank you for the 100 bits, MustardMine!
</pre>

Channel moderators may add and edit these responses below.
