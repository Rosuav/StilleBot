# Using StilleBot

StilleBot is a Twitch channel bot. This one operates under the name "$$botname$$",
but [the source code](https://github.com/rosuav/stillebot) is available to anyone
who wishes to use it, learn from it, or borrow code from it.

$$yourname$$ $$loglink$$

## For broadcasters

If StilleBot is serving as your channel bot, a number of configuration pages are
available to you. You have full power to create $$link||commands$$, have the bot
$$link||triggers respond to things people say$$, or $$link||specials stream support$$,
and there are various $$link||features chat features$$ that can be quickly enabled
and disabled.

If you'd like StilleBot to be added to your channel, contact the bot owner! For
reasons of etiquette and safety, the bot will not speak in any channel unless
explicitly invited, so contact $$botname$$ for more information about that.
