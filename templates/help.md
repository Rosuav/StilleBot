# Using StilleBot

StilleBot is a Twitch channel bot. This one operates under the name "$$botname$$",
but [the source code](https://github.com/rosuav/stillebot) is available to anyone
who wishes to use it, learn from it, or borrow code from it.

$$yourname$$ $$loglink$$

## For broadcasters

If StilleBot is serving as your channel bot, a number of configuration pages are
available to you. If you'd like StilleBot to be added to your channel, contact
the bot owner! For reasons of etiquette and safety, the bot will not speak in any
channel unless explicitly invited, so contact $$botowner$$ for more information.

### Key bot features

When the bot is active in a channel, you can create $$link||commands$$, have the bot
$$link||triggers respond to things people say$$, or $$link||specials stream support$$,
and there are various $$link||features chat features$$ that can be quickly enabled
and disabled.

For more details on any of these features, see their individual pages, or go to your
channel's $$link|| landing page$$. $$anon||Note that you will need to log in using the
button above before these features will be available.$$

### Features for any streamer

Even if the bot is not directly serving your channel, some tools are available via
the web here.

#### Hype train stats

[Real-time hype train stats](/hypetrain?for=$$chan$$). Get detailed information
on progress, unlockable emotes, etc. Requires broadcaster authentication the first
time, but then can be used by everyone.

This is similar to, but not quite the same as, the in-chat notifications from Twitch.
Notably, it will tell you precisely how many bits to complete the level (not just the
percentage done), and can show *all* the unlockable emotes (not just the one next
tier). Has a mobile-friendlier version for those on-the-go.

#### Channel statistics

Want more information about your channel? Got you covered!

* [Recognizing your top cheerers](/bitsbadges). Who has the highest bits badges in
  your channel? Who has access to your bit emotes?
* [Emote showcase](/emotes?broadcaster=$$chan$$). Show off your glorious emotes in
  large format, tidily organized by how they're unlocked.

#### Giveaways

StilleBot can manage a [giveaway](/giveaway) that your viewers enter using their Twitch
channel points. (This requires partnership or affiliation; if you're neither, there are
other tools which use chat commands to manage giveaways.)

Start by setting everything up - choosing how many points to enter, how many tickets a
single viewer can buy, etc. Then open the giveaway, let people buy tickets, and finally,
pick a winner!

For in-chat notifications, click the "Create Default Notifications" wait-late button.
You can then customize the notifications if you wish, but that's entirely optional.

## For moderators

- Mention that a lot of broadcaster pages are available to you too

## For everyone

- Mention things like waitlate
