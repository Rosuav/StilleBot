# Emotes available to the bot

<style>
p {max-width: 80em;}
.highlight {background-color: #dfd; border: 1px solid green;}
</style>

Emotes highlighted in this way can be relied upon more than non-highlighted emotes,
as they come from permanent subscriptions. They may be removed or altered by their
creators, but should not expire on their own.
{: .highlight}

Unhighlighted emotes may disappear
from the bot at any time, but can be restored with a gift subscription.
