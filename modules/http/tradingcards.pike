Streamer trading cards
DeviCat - Canadian, Cat-Lover, Coffee, Kawaii
JessicaMaiArtist - Canadian

* Landing page does not list all cards, but lists categories with a minimum of 5 (tweakable if nec) streamers
* Streamers can have any (reasonable) number of categories, including unusual ones.
* When looking at a collection (canonically: "Canadian"), you see all cards in that category:
  - Rounded-corners rectangle with a background to make it look like a card
  - Top section is the streamer's avatar/PFP
  - Underneath, "Streamer â€” " + display_name
  - Rarity indicator??
  - Rules box lists categories, one per line
    - Flavor text??
  - Fancy it up with boxes and stuff
  - If logged-in user is not following this streamer, opacity 80%, saturation 0
* Anyone you're not following, offer to link to the channel
* Have a raid finder mode to show who's live from that collection (link to it from the trading cards page)
