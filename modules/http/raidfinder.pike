* [Your follow list](raidfinder). This is the normal and default mode, and shows
  your own follow list sorted according to your own channel's statistics. Requires
  login. Can give recent raid statistics.
* [Your stream team(s), if any](raidfinder?team=). If you're a member of any teams,
  this will show you everyone in them who's live! (Excluding yourself.)
* <form><label>Recommendations for another streamer: <input name=for size=20></label> <input type=submit value=View></form>
  Show your follow list, but compare against another channel's statistics. Requires
  login. Can give recent raid statistics, if bot is active for the target channel.
* <form><label>Browse a category: <input name=categories size=20></label> <input type=submit value=Browse></form>
  Show any category - note that large categories may take a while to load! Does not
  require a login.
* [Categories you follow](raidfinder?categories) - everyone who's currently
  online in any of the categories you follow. Note that Twitch's own list of your
  followed channels is currently independent from channels followed on this tool.
* <form><label>Explore a stream team: <input name=team size=20></label> <input type=submit value=View></form>
  Show any stream team by name (look in the URL - not always the same as the display).
* [Pixel Plush users](raidfinder?categories=pixelplush) - everyone who's currently
  using games from [Pixel Plush](https://pixelplush.dev). The same channels as are
  seen on their homepage carousel. No login required.
* [The bot's channels](raidfinder?login=demo) - only those channels for which the
  bot is active. Requires no login. Suitable as a demo but not very useful.
* [Summary of everyone you follow](raidfinder?allfollows) for note taking. Includes
  channels not currently online; can be slow to load.
* [Return the Favour](raidfinder?raiders) - list everyone currently live who has
  raided you. Add `for=otherstreamer`?? TODO.
* [Highlighted streamers](raidfinder?highlights) - only those streamers you've
  listed in your highlight list.
