# Activate the bot for your channel

Welcome to the Mustard Mine family!

To activate this bot on your channel, you'll need to authenticate and confirm that you want
to do this. There is no cost, this just ensures that the bot is only where he is wanted :)

# Activate the bot for your channel

Welcome to the Mustard Mine family!

The bot is ready to activate for your channel! Just say the word, and the Mustard Mine will
be fully operational and available to be configured to your needs.

# Activate the bot for your channel

The Mustard Mine is currently serving your channel! You can [configure the bot here](/c/).
If you wish to remove the bot, the [Master Control Panel](/c/mastercontrol) has the option to do so.

What can the bot do for you? Check out the [help pages](/c/help) or dive right in with
[activating features](/c/features).

Still got questions? Reach out to [Rosuav](https://twitch.tv/rosuav) via Twitch, Discord, or GitHub.
