Installing StilleBot on your own system
=======================================

StilleBot, being fully open source, is entirely capable of being run on your own
computer as your own personal bot. You will need:

* Pike version 8.1 or better, with GTK support
* A Twitch developer account and the appropriate keys
* Optionally an [SSL certificate](SSL)

Support for platforms other than Linux is on a "best-effort" basis. If you have
issues, be prepared to work with me to solve them, as I can't directly test on
these systems myself.

Start the bot using `pike stillebot.pike`. It should open its GUI and invite you
to authenticate it with Twitch. At very least, you will need an OAuth token for
chat connection, and for full functionality, you will need a client ID/secret,
obtained from the [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console).

Enabling the web configuration interface is strongly recommended, but basic
features can be managed through Twitch chat itself.
