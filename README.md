## Mustard Mine

!["Mustard Mine" banner](/httpstatic/MustardMinePanel.png)

Mustard Mine handles Twitch chat and some other functionality. The name harkens back to a
conversation between [Alice Liddell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Liddell) and the
[Duchess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchess_(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland)) in
the famous book [Alice's Adventures in Wonderland](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland_(1866)/Chapter_9#134);
the motto of this bot is: "The more work there is of mine, the less there is of yours".

The [source code](https://github.com/rosuav/stillebot) for this bot is available under the
terms of the [MIT License](LICENSE) and can be found on GitHub. [Installing and running
your own instance of the bot](INSTALL) is possible and legal, though may take some effort.
(The bot software is named StilleBot after Oberstille, because he joked around with me about
names right at the time when I needed to figure out a name. (On such thin threads...) The
actual running bot is the Mustard Mine. The names can be used broadly interchangeably.)

The reference bot is operated by [Rosuav](https://twitch.tv/rosuav) and is accessible at
https://mustardmine.com/ where he serves a number of Twitch channels.

## What can the Mustard Mine do for you?

### Running a channel

When Mustard Mine is the primary bot for a Twitch channel, a number of features are available.

* Classic information/response commands, including shoutouts, automated commands (timers),
  quotes, etc, etc.
* A full-power command editor to allow the streamer and mods to edit these commands
* Twitch alerts (eg when someone follows, subs, cheers, etc)
* Goal bars of various kinds
* Giveaway management
* Channel point redemptions, including dynamic management of the rewards themselves
* Art sharing with upload capability

Mustard Mine is perfectly happy to coexist with other bots, and if he is working in a
secondary role, features can be enabled on an "as-needed" basis, with the bot quietly
lurking until called upon.

Details on a number of standard commands can be found in [these pages](https://rosuav.github.io/StilleBot/commands/).

To see what the bot would be like if working for you, explore [Demo Mode](https://mustardmine.com/channels/demo/)
where the bot pretends that you are a mod for a (fake) channel named "!Demo".

### See What's Happening

Even for people and channels where the Mustard Mine is not an active bot, some services
are available! Some of these require authentication.

* [Emote showcase](https://mustardmine.com/emotes?broadcaster=rosuav) for any
  Twitch channel. Shows off your emotes, nice and large, and can also let you see them
  in greyscale.
* [Raid Finder](https://mustardmine.com/raidfinder) to help you pick out a raid
  target, or just to check your follow list in a more useful way
* [Hype Train tracker](https://mustardmine.com/hypetrain) to see where the train is
  up to, exactly what it'll take to finish the current level, and how long the cooldown
  is. Requires permission from the broadcaster.

### Other tools

A few tools don't really connect with any specific channel, and can be used by anyone.

* [Emote checklist](https://mustardmine.com/checklist) of all the unlockable emotes
  (Hype Train, special promo, etc)
* [Regular Expression tester](https://mustardmine.com/regexp) primarily for people
  editing triggers and commands that use regular expressions
* [Pixel Plush showcase](https://mustardmine.com/raidfinder?categories=pixelplush) -
  everyone who's currently using any of the [Pixel Plush](https://pixelplush.dev)
  games. Try the <code>!drop</code> or <code>!plinko</code> command in their chat!

## Can I haz?

Yes! The bot is available for any streamer to make use of!

To activate the bot in your channel, [here's the place to be](https://mustardmine.com/activate).
Once activated, the bot will remain active until the broadcaster requests its removal
(in the [Master Control Panel](https://mustardmine.com/c/mastercontrol)), and all of its
features will be available from the [channel configuration pages](https://mustardmine.com/c/).
