## StilleBot

StilleBot handles Twitch chat and some other functionality. It's named after
Oberstille, because he joked around with me about names right at the time when
I needed to figure out a name. (On such thin threads...)

The source code for StilleBot is available under the terms of the [MIT License](LICENSE)
and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/rosuav/stillebot). [Installing and running
your own instance of the bot](INSTALL) is possible and legal, though may take some effort.

The reference bot goes by the name [Rosuav](https://twitch.tv/rosuav) and is accessible at
https://sikorsky.rosuav.com/ where he serves a number of Twitch channels.

## What can StilleBot do for you?

### Running a channel

When StilleBot is the primary bot for a Twitch channel, a number of features are available.

* Classic information/response commands, including shoutouts, automated commands (timers),
  quotes, etc, etc.
* A full-power command editor to allow the streamer and mods to edit these commands
* Twitch alerts (eg when someone follows, subs, cheers, etc)
* Giveaway management
* Channel point redemptions
* Art sharing with upload capability

StilleBot is perfectly happy to coexist with other bots, and if he is working in a
secondary role, features can be enabled on an "as-needed" basis, with the bot quietly
lurking until called upon.

Details on a number of standard commands can be found in [these pages](https://rosuav.github.io/StilleBot/commands/).

To see what the bot would be like if working for you, explore [Demo Mode](https://sikorsky.rosuav.com/channels/demo/)
where the bot pretends that you are a mod for a (fake) channel named "!Demo".

### See What's Happening

Even for people and channels where StilleBot is not an active bot, some services are
available! Some of these require authentication.

* [Emote showcase](https://sikorsky.rosuav.com/emotes?broadcaster=rosuav) for any
  Twitch channel. Shows off your emotes, nice and large, and can also let you see them
  in greyscale.
* [Raid Finder](https://sikorsky.rosuav.com/raidfinder) to help you pick out a raid
  target, or just to check your follow list in a more useful way
* [Hype Train tracker](https://sikorsky.rosuav.com/hypetrain) to see where the train is
  up to, exactly what it'll take to finish the current level, and how long the cooldown
  is. Requires permission from the broadcaster.

### Other tools

A few tools don't really connect with any specific channel, and can be used by anyone.

* [Emote checklist](https://sikorsky.rosuav.com/checklist) of all the unlockable emotes
  (Hype Train, special promo, etc)
* [Regular Expression tester](https://sikorsky.rosuav.com/regexp) primarily for people
  editing triggers and commands that use regular expressions
* TODO: Raid train management

## Can I haz?

Yes! Well, probably. Depends what you want!

To request that StilleBot be added to your channel, contact Rosuav.

(TODO: Have a thing here to make that easier?)

(TODO: Figure out some wording for "hey don't make me swear kthx", with caveat that
you can authenticate your own voice and use that)
