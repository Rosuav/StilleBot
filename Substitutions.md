Variable substitutions in command execution
===========================================

(Note: "Command execution" refers also to triggers, specials, and any other
related features.)

Mustard Mine commands have access to a variety of extra information. These
notations can be used to include this information in your messages:

* $varname$ - variables created by and for your own channel. For example,
  you might have a counter for the number of times you've died: $deaths$
* $*varname$ - variables associated with the current user (within this
  channel). These are tracked separately for all users that use them.
* $kwd*varname$ - variables associated with a specific user - see the
  "User Vars" builtin to specify the user
* $varname?$ - ephemeral variables which can be accessed identically to
  others, but are not saved across bot restarts. These may disappear at
  any time, but will usually stick around for months. They will not be
  shown in the /variables page for the channel. Note that this can be
  combined with per-user notation also, creating a per-user ephemeral.
* {token} - information provided by a builtin or special trigger. When a
  command calls on a builtin, it will receive a specific set of keywords
  which can be used in this way.
* {param}, {emotedparam} - extra text on the end of the command. They can
  also be accessed via shorthands "%s" and "%e". For regular commands, this
  comes from chat (so in "!so username", "{param}" is "username"); for
  triggers, it's the text that triggered it; etcetera. The shortforms are
  exactly equivalent to the named forms if no filter or default is needed.
* {username} - the name of the person who invoked or caused this action.
  Can be accessed via shorthand "$$".

All substitutions can be modified with a filter and/or a default. For
instance, a token of {uptime} will be a number (represented with decimal
digits); using {uptime|hms|offline} will use the uptime if it exists,
otherwise will use the string "offline".

TODO: Are there any others that don't come through that way?
