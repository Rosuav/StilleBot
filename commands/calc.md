# !calc: Calculate something, possibly involving channel variables

Usage: `!calc 1 + 2 * 3`

If you are a moderator, this will expand variables. This is therefore
the quickest way to see the value of any variable:

`!calc $deaths$`

To avoid leaking private variables to non-moderators, unfortunately
this feature must be restricted. But numbers themselves are fine :)
