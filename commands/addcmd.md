# !addcmd: Add an echo command for this channel

Available to: mods only

Usage: `!addcmd !newcommandname text-to-echo`

If the command already exists as an echo command, it will be updated. If it
exists as a global command, the channel-specific echo command will shadow it
(meaning that the global command cannot be accessed in this channel). Please
do not shoot yourself in the foot :)
