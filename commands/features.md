# !features: Enable or disable bot features.

Available to: mods only

Part of manageable feature: features

Usage: `!features featurename {enable|disable|default}`

Features set to the 'default' state follow the setting for allcmds, so in
general, you need only specify the features that are different from that.

Note that features disabled here may still be available via the bot's web
interface.
