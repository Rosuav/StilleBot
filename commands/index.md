This information has been autogenerated from the StilleBot source code.

Below is a list of (nearly) every command that StilleBot supports. Note that
some commands are specific to one or more channels, and many are available only
to moderators; to see which commands *you* have access to, type `!help` into
the channel you want to check.

Commands in alphabetical order:

* [!addcmd: Add an echo command for this channel](addcmd)
* [!help: List commands available to you](help)

---

If the command you seek is not mentioned here, it is possibly a channel-specific
echo command.
