Mustard Mine can perform a large number of tasks for you, the viewer; these commands
are all created on a per-channel basis, but some will be common across channels,
perhaps with some small adjustment to wording.

* `!calc` provides a very simple in-chat calculator. Enter a mathematical expression
  and get back a result: `!calc 1 + 2` will tell you that the answer is 3. This can
  work with decimal fractions (`!calc 3.5 + 7.5` will respond with `11`) but not with
  symbolic values (sorry, no `!calc pi` here).
* `!followage` reports how long you've been following this channel. Flex that longevity!
* `!addquote` will add a channel [quote](/c/quotes), great for remembering funny or
  adorable moments. Start with a user name `!addquote MustardMine I am a bot` to cite
  the person; include emotes as desired, and they will be retained. This command is
  usually restricted to moderators, with the corresponding `!quote` command (to *view*
  quotes) being available to everyone.
* `!shoutout someperson` (equivalently `!so someperson`) to recommend a broadcaster to
  your community, with a fancy Twitch shoutout as well as an in-chat description.
* `!hypetrain` reports in chat about the current [Hype Train](/hypetrain) status.

If the command you seek is not mentioned here, it is possibly a channel-specific
command. The broadcaster may have made some information public on the corresponding
page, eg [/channels/rosuav/commands](/channels/rosuav/commands) for Rosuav's commands.
