# !quote: View a chosen or randomly-selected quote

Pick a random quote with `!quote`, or call up one in particular by giving its
reference number, such as `!quote 42`. Quotes are per-channel and any mod can
add more quotes, so when funny things happen, use the !addquote
command to save it for posterity!
